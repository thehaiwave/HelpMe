# Super-Cobra-Jet-Inventory | CS HL Final Project ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.1-yellow.svg) [![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-no-red.svg)](https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/ansi-colors)
This inventory system was originally built as the final project for my High Level Computer Science IB course. It's mainly designed for product data entry and storage
by using text files as a database of sorts. The commit messages aren't super professional because, being a final project, I wasn't originally planning on making it public. Also I was just starting to use Git. Why is it on GitHub to begin with? Because I lost the original project and started saving the new one on GitHub in case something happened. I have been scared of SSDs ever since. What you see here is but a mere shadow of the project's former self, a hastily assembled replacement held together by hopes and dreams. Somehow I got a 6 out of 7. Go figure.


## Installation

No libraries other than the ones standard to Java were used, so the only real dependency is Java itself. Also, no executables were made for this program so it needs
to be compiled by whoever uses this thing. Pretty neat, huh?


## Usage
The program is pretty straightforward. On startup, it will display a menu from which you can choose to either enter data, or see the data saved to the text files.
If you choose to enter data, you type the product data in the corresponding input fields, and then you save it. After that, the program will sort the entered
products by month and write the data to the corresponding text files, after which they can be viewed.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, I guess.
