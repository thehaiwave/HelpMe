# Super-Cobra-Jet-Inventory | CS HL Final Project ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.1-yellow.svg) [![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-no-red.svg)](https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/ansi-colors)
This inventory system was originally built as the final project for my High Level Computer Science IB course. It's mainly designed for product data entry and storage
by using text files as a database. The commit messages aren't super professional because, being a final project, I wasn't originally planning on making it public. Also I was just starting to use Git.


## Installation

No libraries other than the ones standard to Java were used, so the only real dependency is Java itself. No executables were made for this program, so it needs
to be compiled by whoever uses this thing.


## Usage
The program is pretty straightforward. On startup, it will display a menu from which you can choose to either enter data, or see the data saved to the text files.
If you choose to enter data, you type the product data in the corresponding input fields, and then you save it. After that, the program will sort the entered
products by month and write the data to the corresponding text files, after which they can be viewed.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, I guess.
